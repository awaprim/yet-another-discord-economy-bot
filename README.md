# Discord.js economy bot ig

this project is in development and therefore has practically nothing in it, so you can't use the coins you have in this bot for now..

also slash commands are coming at some point too

## Usage

clone this repo and install dependencies
```bash
git clone https://github.com/awaprimPL/yet-another-discord-economy-bot.git
cd yet-another-discord-economy-bot
npm i
```
make sure to set stuff in file .env from .env.example
also make sure to create database in supabase (as its what is used for this) you can find SQL code for creating latest version of tables inside file db.sql (most likely its gonna be changed with time to add new stuffz)


to run it:
```bash
npm start
```
